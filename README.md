## Auto-Generated README Follows...

This project was generated by the Go ABCWeb web app framework: 
https://github.com/volatiletech/abcweb -- See here for readme.

### Example run 

`VOTEM_VOTE_ENV` is the environment variable that specifies which
config.toml configuration mode/section to use.

`./votem-vote` will use the default mode of `prod`.

`VOTEM_VOTE_ENV=dev ./votem-vote`
`VOTEM_VOTE_ENV=prod ./votem-vote`

### Configuration

This project loads configuration in the order of:

1. command line argument default values
2. config.toml
3. environment variables
4. supplied command line arguments

This means that values passed into the command line will
override values passed in through the config.toml and env vars, and so on.
